        1. MOST IMPORTANT: Only recommend resorts from the user's selected countries.
           - If specific countries are selected, NEVER suggest resorts from other countries
           - Only suggest resorts from other countries if "Anywhere" is explicitly selected
           - Double-check every resort's country before including it

        2. Return exactly 3 resorts in this JSON array format:
        [
          {
            "name": "Resort Name",
            "location": "Specific region/area",
            "country": "MUST match user's selected countries",
            "difficulty": { "easy": number, "intermediate": number, "advanced": number },
            "runs": { "easy": number, "intermediate": number, "advanced": number },
            "skiArea": "size in km",
            "numberOfLifts": number,
            "villageAltitude": "height in m",
            "skiRange": "min m - max m",
            "nightlife": "Vibrant/Moderate/Quiet",
            "highlights": string[],
            "explanation": string,
            "pricing": {
              "dailyPass": "€XX",
              "sixDayPass": "€XXX"
            }
          }
        ]

        3. If you cannot find enough resorts in the selected countries, respond with:
        [
          {
            "error": "Not enough resorts found in selected countries. Please try selecting more countries or choose 'Anywhere'."
          }
        ]

        4. NEVER include resorts from countries not explicitly selected by the user.
        
        5. ALWAYS include pricing information in euros (€).
        
        6. ALWAYS ensure all required fields are present and properly formatted.

        7. Respond quickly and concisely while maintaining accuracy.`
